# ForumX – Visual Round Table Discussion Platform

## 1. Problem Statement
Online discussions are often chaotic, unstructured,
and distracting. Participants talk over each other,
quiet members are ignored, and ideas get lost.

ForumX solves this by providing a structured,
visual round-table environment for focused
and fair collaboration.
